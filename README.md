When PHP arrays meet C#: an all-rounded reinterpretation of Lists.

## Situation
Consider a task that uses a `List<T>`:
- Receive/append many items
- Remove many elements *in place*: to conserve memory, in case your list is large

We quickly notice problems when removing many items in-place from `List<T>`:
- This is actually `O(n^2)`! (where n = number of items in the list)
- Can't keep old indexes (perhaps we need them for later)
- Can't do that in a `foreach` loop

We also notice the problems of the alternatives:
- `Array<T>` does not automatically resize: tedious memory management
- It is very slow to insert many data into `Dictionary<int,T>`
  - By the way, `HashSet<T>` is essentially equivalent to `Dictionary<T,void>`
- LINQ expressions are usually the fastest, but will require extra memory allocation when building the solution `List<T>`
- Or, perhaps the problem asks for a `foreach` solution with side effects, such that LINQ is not suitable

This is a bad situation between a rock and a hard place.

Inspired by PHP's highly unconventional approach to implement arrays, lists and maps,
this C# package introduces a hybrid between the `List<T>` type and the `Dictionary<TKey,TValue>` type: the `DictionaryList<T>` type.

Do not be afraid of the PHP origin.
While there are some trade-offs when migrating from `List<T>` to `DictionaryList<T>` (see the Characteristics and the Benchmarking sections),
rest assured that `DictionaryList<T>` really works well.

## Install

```shell
dotnet add package Vectorial1024.DictionaryList
```

### Change log

### Todos

## Characteristics of `DictionaryList<TValue>`
Consider the following primer table:

|                      | List Behavior             | Dictionary Behavior      |
|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| List Structure       | `List<T>`                 | `ListDictionary<int, T>` |
| Dictionary Structure | üëâ `DictionaryList<T>` üëà | `Dictionary<int, T>`     |

A `DictionaryList<T>` is a `List<T>` that has `Dictionary`-like structure.

The theme of a `DictionaryList<T>` is "deferred reindexing".
Compared to a `List<T>`, there are some characteristics/restrictions:
- No `Insert()`; use `Append()` instead
- No `RemoveAt()`; use `UnsetAt()` instead, which leaves behind "memory gaps"
- Memory gaps may be reused if you know their indexes; also see `ContainsIndex()`
- Enumeration yields `KeyValuePair<int,T>` and skips over unset rows
- No `TrimExcess()`; use `CompactAndTrimExcess()` instead
- `UnsetAt()` during `foreach` is allowed!

Perhaps this can be better demonstrated with some code sample.

## Usage
The API is similar to a `List<T>` (see the docstring or your IDE for the latest info).
Still, you may consider the following sample code:

```csharp
// basic usage sample code

// create a new DictionaryList
var dictList = new DictionaryList<int>;

// add some items to it
dictList.Add(1); // index 0
dictList.Add(2); // index 1
dictList.Add(3); // index 2
dictList.Add(4); // index 3
dictList.Add(5); // index 4

// how many items?
_ = dictList.Count; // 5

// read from it
_ = dictList.ContainsIndex(3); // true
_ = dictList[3]; // 4

// write to it
dictList[3] = 12;
_ = dictList[3]; // 12
// dictList[99] = 99999; // out of bounds; not allowed!
// dictList[-4] = 42; // out of bounds; not allowed!

// remove from it
// note: removed items can be GC-ed if that was the last reference to it
dictList.UnsetAt(1);
_ = dictList.ContainsIndex(1); // false
_ = dictList.Count; // 4
// _ = dictList[1]; // out of bounds; not allowed!

// "revive" indexes, but we recommend Add() if you do not care about the value of indexes.
dictList[1] = 11;
_ = dictList[1]; // 11;

// let's delete it again...
dictList.UnsetAt(1);

// ...to demonstrate traversal
foreach (var kv in dictList) 
{
    _ = (kv.Key, kv.Value);
    // yields in order: (0, 1), (2, 3), (3, 12), (4, 5); 4 items!
}

// we have a gap at index=1; reclaim gaps by doing:
dictList.CompactAndTrimExcess();

// we are done with the data; clear everything by doing:
dictList.Clear();
_ = dictList.Count; // 0
```

### Thread Safety?
`DictionaryList<T>` is NOT thread safe!

### Native AOT?
`DictionaryList<T>` is compatible with Native AOT.

## Benchmarking
This package is benchmarked with the BenchmarkDotNet package.

To run the benchmark:

```shell
# BenchmarkDotNet strongly recommends benchmarking in Release mode
dotnet run -c=Release --project=Benchmarking
```

### Quick performance comparison between relevant collection types
A benchmark was run with version `0.1.2` of this library. Its detailed results can be found in `BENCHMARK.md`.

But still, here is a table outlining the performances when `N = 100000`:

| Task                                | List        | DictionaryList | Dictionary | SortedDictionary |

| Emit Key/Index During `foreach`     | ü§∑ [1]      | ‚úîÔ∏è             | ‚úîÔ∏è         | ‚úîÔ∏è               |
| Replace Items During `foreach`      | ü§∑ [1]      | ‚úîÔ∏è             | ‚úîÔ∏è         | ‚ùå if key exists  |

You may see that `DictionaryList<T>` is an all-rounded, midway solution between a `List<T>` and a `Dictionary<TKey,TValue>`.

As part of the benchmark, you may also see that `SortedDictionary<TKey,TValue>` is generally a bad type to use compared to other similar types.

The following collection types are excluded from the benchmarking:
- `HashSet<T>`: too similar to `Dictionary<T, void>`, probably has similar performance
- `OrderedDictionary`: ambiguity between intended `<int, T>` usage and `this[int]` syntax
- `LinkedList<T>`: unfair/impossible comparison due to lack of index access
- `SortedList<int,T>`: too similar to `SortedDictionary<int, T>`, probably has similar performance

## Testing
This package uses NUnit for testing.

Run the tests with:

```shell
dotnet test
```

## Appendix
[1] Technically, this can be done with Enumerable LINQ's `Index` method, but using LINQ with `foreach` is perhaps an antipattern.
