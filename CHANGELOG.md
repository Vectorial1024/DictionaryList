# Change Log of `DictionaryList`
This package follows semantic versioning. When in doubt, refer to the latest docstrings.

## Dev (WIP)
Initial release.

The `DictionaryList<T>` is essentially a `List<T>` that allows deferred reindexing when adding/removing items. See the readme for more info.

This version is a minimally-viable product of this package. However, further optimization and refinement can still be made.
